The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in his/her career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of what we preach. The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has done it all. This means that what you hear is the real stuff.

Students will participate in a field trip to an operating mine. <br /></br>*Only students enrolled in the Lassonde Mineral Engineering program are eligible to participate in the 2nd year field trip.</p><br>", "fallsections": {"PRA0101": ["", "", "", [["MB400", ["T", 9.0, 11.0]]]], "TUT0101": ["", "", "Hadjigeorgiou, Ioannis (John)", [["GB117", ["R", 10.0, 11.0]]]], "LEC0101": ["", "", "Hadjigeorgiou, Ioannis (John) and Moss, Roger and Barati Sedeh, Mansoor", [["GB117", ["R", 9.0, 10.0]]]]}, "TUT": 1.0, "code": "MIN225H1", "SC": ["F"], "CR": 0.5, "SEM": 0, "name": "Introduction to the Resource Industries"}, "CIV280H1": {"LEC": 3.0, "PRA": 0.0, "description": "<p>An introduction to the management of construction projects including: the nature of the industry, project delivery alternatives, legal and ethical considerations, the Safety Act and construction regulations, labour relations, construction contracts, risk distribution, project planning and scheduling, estimating and bidding, controlling of time, cost and quality, accounting leading to financial statements, dispute resolution, as well as new and evolving concepts in managing construction.</p><br>", "fallsections": {"TUT0101": ["", "", "McCabe, Brenda", [["HA401", ["R", 9.0, 11.0]]]], "TUT0102": ["", "", "", [["HA403", ["R", 9.0, 11.0]]]], "LEC0101": ["", "", "McCabe, Brenda", [["GB119", ["T", 10.0, 11.0]]]]}, "TUT": 2.0, "name": "Management of Construction", "code": "CIV280H1", "SC": ["F"], "CR": 0.5, "SEM": 0, "Exclusion": "CIV320H1."}, "APS490Y1": {"LEC": 0.0, "PRA": 0.0, "description": "<p>An experience in multi-disciplinary engineering practice through a significant, open-ended, client-driven design project in which student teams address stakeholder needs through the use of a creative and iterative design process.</p><br>", "fallsections": {"TUT0101": ["", "", "Behdinan, Kamran", [["BA1220", ["R", 19.0, 21.0]]]]}, "TUT": 3.0, "name": "Multi-Disciplinary Capstone Design", "code": "APS490Y1", "SC": ["Y"], "CR": 1.0, "SEM": 0, "Prerequisite": "Permission of student's home department", "Exclusion": "<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CHE430Y1\">CHE430Y1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CIV498H1\">CIV498H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MIE490Y1\">MIE490Y1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MIE491Y1\">MIE491Y1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ECE496Y1\">ECE496Y1</a>/ <a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ESC470H1\">ESC470H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ESC471H1\">ESC471H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ESC472H1\">ESC472H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MSE498Y1\">MSE498Y1</a>"}, "ECE316H1": {"LEC": 3.0, "PRA": 1.5, "description": "<p>An introductory course in analog and digital communication systems.
