This requirement may also be met by participating in the PEY (Professional Experience Year) program. 

Preparing for graduate study in Computer Science

Strong students should consider the option of further study in graduate school (where the degrees offered are typically M.Sc. and Ph.D.).  If you find yourself frequently receiving marks in the B+ range or better, you should consult with faculty members to learn more about graduate school and whether it would be a good option for you. You will want to ask for advice on your particular interests — and you will find faculty members are happy to talk to you — but there are also some course choices that should be considered by all students thinking of graduate study in Computer Science.

The focuses can help you further refine your areas of interest, but you should not take courses exclusively in one area. You will benefit by having taken an advanced course requiring considerable software development and a theoretical course.

It will be especially beneficial to have done a project course (CSC494H1/CSC495H1), a capstone course (CSC490H1/CSC491H1), and/or a summer research project. It is good if this individual work is in the area where you eventually decide you'd like to do your own research, but that is not essential; what you need most is some experience doing work on your own, under the mentorship of an experienced researcher.

Choosing courses

This program offers considerable freedom to choose courses at the 300-/400-level, and you are free to make those choices on your own. We are eager to offer guidance, however, and both our Undergraduate Office and individual faculty members are a rich source of advice.


Computer Science Specialist: Focuses
You have the option of completing one or more of the focuses defined below. Focuses are sets of courses that direct you toward expertise in particular areas of Computer Science, such as game design, theory of computation, human-computer interaction, and many more. These focuses are meant to help your choice, not to constrain it, and each focus has at least one faculty member who would be happy to discuss it with you.

More information about each of the focuses can be found on our web site at http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/programs.htm

Each focus has a set of required courses that must be completed to satisfy the focus. Most focuses also have an additional list of related courses that students in the focus may find interesting.  In some cases these are courses offered by different departments or faculties.  Note that you must petition to take Engineering courses or graduate-level courses.

In many cases, the courses required of the focus will also satisfy Specialist program requirements. Focuses that require courses in addition to the Specialist requirements have a note in the descriptions below.

To enrol in one or more focuses, students must first be enrolled in the Computer Science Specialist program. Enrolment instructions can be found on the Arts & Science Current Students subject POSt enrolment web site. Focuses can be chosen on ROSI after admission to the program, which begins in July.

Focus in Scientific Computing (3.5 FCEs)

Scientific computing studies the world around us. Known and unknown quantities are related through certain rules, e.g. physical laws, formulating mathematical problems. These problems are solved by numerical methods implemented as algorithms and run on computers. The numerical methods are analyzed and their performance (e.g. accuracy, efficiency) studied. Problems, such as choosing the optimal shape for an airplane (to achieve, for example, minimal fuel consumption), finding the fair price for derivative products of the market, or regulating the amount of radiation in medical scans, can be modeled by mathematical expressions, and solved by numerical techniques.

Students wishing to study scientific computing should have a strong background in mathematics, in particular calculus of several variables, linear algebra and statistics, be fluent in programming, and have a good understanding of data structures and algorithm design.

Required Courses:

     1. MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1,
     2. 1.5 FCE from the following: CSC336H1, CSC436H1, CSC446H1, 456H1

Suggested Related Courses:

MAT224H1/MAT240H1, MAT244H1, MAT334H1/MAT354H1, MAT337H1/MAT357H1
It is also recommended that students in this focus consider taking a half-course or two from the basic sciences (such as physics, chemistry, biology), as these sciences provide the sources of many problems solved by numerical techniques.

Focus in Artificial Intelligence (3.5 FCEs)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is aimed at understanding and replicating the computational processes underlying intelligent behaviour. These behaviours include the perception of one's environment, learning how that environment is structured, communicating with other agents, and reasoning to guide one's actions. This focus is designed to provide students with an introduction to some of the key scientific and technical ideas that have been developed in AI. There are four different sub-areas of AI represented in our department: Computer Vision, Computational Linguistics (CL), Machine Learning (ML), and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR). These areas cover a wide variety of ideas and techniques. Students wanting to achieve this focus are required to take courses from at least two of these sub-areas.

Required Courses:

     1. 1 FCE from the following: MAT235Y1/237Y1/257Y1, APM236H1/MIE262H1/STA248/261H1, CSC336H1, CSC310H1, CSC330H1, CSC438H1, CSC448H1, CSC463H1

Focus in Computational Linguistics & Natural Language Processing (4.0 FCEs)

How can we build and analyze systems for enabling users to communicate with computers using human language (also called natural language), and for automatically processing the vast amounts of data on the web available in the form of text? The focus covers appropriate material on natural language interfaces, as well as tools such as document summarization, intelligent search over the web, and so on. Students considering this focus are encouraged to consider a second Major in Linguistics. [Note 0.5 FCEs in LIN are in addition to the 12.0 FCEs required to complete the Specialist program]

Other relevant Computer Science courses, depending on the student's interests, include other courses in artificial intelligence such as CSC384H1 or CSC420H1. Linguistics, Psychology, and Cognitive Science are all directly relevant to this focus, and we recommend that interested students take additional courses from any or all of them.

Focus in Computer Vision  (3.5 FCEs)

Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that can see. As a science, the goal of computer vision is to understand the computational processes required for a machine to come to an understanding of the content of a set of images. The data here may be a single snapshot, a video sequence, or a set of images from different viewpoints or provided by medical scanners.

The computer vision focus introduces students to the study of vision from a computational point of view. That is, we attempt to clearly define computational problems for various steps of the overall process, and then show how these problems can be tackled with appropriate algorithms.

Students who wish to pursue computer vision should have an understanding of linear algebra and calculus of several variables. Moreover, they should be solid programmers and have a good understanding of data structures and algorithm design. These basic tools are required in order to first pose computational vision problems, and then develop and test algorithms for their solution.

Required Courses:

     1. MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1, CSC320H1, CSC336H1, CSC411H1, CSC420H1

Focus in Computer Systems (3.5 FCEs)

Software systems are complex and interesting. Poorly done systems can be incredibly expensive: they can cost society billions of dollars, and sometimes make the difference between life and death. Rapid changes in technology and applications means that the underlying systems must continually adapt. This focus takes you under the covers of software systems, laying bare the layers and introducing you to concurrency issues, scalability, multiprocessor systems, distributed computing, and more.

     3. ECO326H1, MGT2056H

Focus in Human-Computer Interaction (6.5 FCEs)

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the scientific study of the use of computers by people and the design discipline that informs the creation of systems and software that are useful, usable, and enjoyable for the people who use them. HCI students have exciting opportunities for research and graduate school; HCI professionals often have jobs with titles such as user interface architect, user interface specialist, interaction designer, or usability engineer.

Human factors is a sister discipline to human-computer interaction that approaches problems in slightly different ways.
     3. WDW260H1

Focus in Theory of Computation (4.5 FCEs + 2.0 FCEs from required Specialist courses)

Why is it easy to sort a list of numbers, but hard to break Internet encryption schemes? Is finding a solution to a problem harder than checking that a solution is correct? Can we find good approximate solutions, even when the exact solutions seem out of reach? Theory of Computation studies the inherent complexity of fundamental algorithmic problems. On one hand, we develop ground-breaking efficient data structures and algorithms. On the other, we have yet to develop good algorithms for many problems despite decades of effort, and for these problems we strive to prove no time- or space-efficient algorithms will ever solve them. While the field has seen some successful impossibility results, there are still many problems -- such that those underlying modern cryptography and security -- for which we do not know either efficient algorithms or strong lower bounds! This focus takes a rigorous, mathematical approach to computational problem-solving: students will gain a deep understanding of algorithm paradigms and measures of problem complexity, and develop the skills necessary to convey abstract ideas with precision and clarity. Many of our students go on to graduate studies and sophisticated algorithmic work in industry. This focus has natural ties with many branches of mathematics and is the foundation of many computer science fields. Consequently, our students often apply their theoretical knowledge to other fields of interest. We strongly encourage taking the enriched theory courses (CSC240H1, CSC265H1, CSC375H1) as well as specialist/major versions of the MAT requirements for our focus. [Depending on courses selected for points 4 & 5, students may need to complete 0.5-1.0 FCEs in addition to the 12.0 FCEs required to complete the Specialist program.]
