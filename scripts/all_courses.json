Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the Entrepreneurs Test. There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.</p><br>Exclusion:\n                    <a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CHE488H1\">CHE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CIV488H1\">CIV488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ECE488H1\">ECE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MIE488H1\">MIE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MSE488H1\">MSE488H1</a>\n", "LEC": 48.0, "course_name": "Entrepreneurship and Small Business", "fallsections": {"TUT0101": ["", "", "", [["GB248", ["W", 20.0, 21.0]]]], "LEC0101": ["", "", "Paradi, Joseph", [["GB248", ["R", 18.0, 20.0]], ["GB248", ["W", 18.0, 20.0]]]]}, "TUT": 12.0, "PRA": 0.0, "SC": ["F"], "CR": 0.5, "course_code": "APS234H1", "SEM": 0}, "CSC372H1": {"course_description": "<p>Development of embedded software for control and monitoring.

This diverse industry has both high volume-low unit value and low volume-high unit value products, and the manufacture of each type of product has its own challenges. The chemical engineering profession applies the scientific fundamentals through two key concepts: Unit Operations as well as Flux. The fundamental elements of stoichiometry and reaction kinetics are further extended to cover the concepts of yield, conversion and their specific applications to continuous and batch reactor systems. Analysis of electrical circuits is introduced, leading to nodal analysis of circuits.

Thus, engineering concerns itself with the materials used and forces and laws of nature, and the needs of people.  Because of scarcity of resources and constraints at all levels, engineering must be closely associated with economics.  It is essential that engineering proposals be evaluated in terms of worth and cost before they are undertaken.  In this course we emphasize that an essential prerequisite of a successful engineering application is economic feasibility.  Hence, investment proposals are evaluated in terms of economic cost concepts, including break even analysis, cost estimation and time value of money.   Effective interest rates, inflation and deflation, depreciation and income tax all affect the viability of an investment. Successful engineering projects are chosen from valid alternatives considering such issues as buy or lease, make or buy, cost and benefits and financing alternatives.

The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by him/herself, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in his/her career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of what we preach. The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has done it all. This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.</p><br>Prerequisite:\n                    APS234 - Entrepreneurship and Small Business Exclusion:\n                    <a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CHE488H1\">CHE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#CIV488H1\">CIV488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#ECE488H1\">ECE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MIE488H1\">MIE488H1</a>/<a href=\"Course_Descriptions.html#MSE488H1\">MSE488H1</a>\n", "LEC": 48.0, "course_name": "Entrepreneurship and Business Management", "TUT": 12.0, "PRA": 0.0, "wintersections": {"LEC0101": ["", "", "Paradi, Joseph", [["GB248", ["R", 18.0, 20.0]], ["GB248", ["W", 18.0, 21.0]]]]}, "SC": ["S"], "CR": 0.5, "course_code": "APS432H1", "SEM": 0}, "GER355Y0": {"course_description": "<p>Students who wish to petition the department for credit toward a specialist or major program in German will be required to do part of their work in German.

These objectives are pursued by introducing students to major trends in inequality in Canada, assessing these trends within a comparative context, reflecting on their normative implications, and examining alternative policy responses to these developments.Restrictedto 4th-year sociology specialists and majors.\r\nPrerequisite:\r\n                    <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC202H1\">SOC202H1</a> and at least .5 FCEs at the SOC 300+ level (preferably selected from the Recommended Preparation list for this course)Recommended Preparation:\r\n                    <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC207H1\">SOC207H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC210H1\">SOC210H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC212H1\">SOC212H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC243H1\">SOC243H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC246H1\">SOC246H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC260H1\">SOC260H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC265H1\">SOC265H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC282H1\">SOC282H1</a>; <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC301Y1\">SOC301Y1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC303H1\">SOC303H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC304H1\">SOC304H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC314H1\">SOC314H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC336H1\">SOC336H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC363H1\">SOC363H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC364H1\">SOC364H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC365H1\">SOC365H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC371H1\">SOC371H1</a> or <a href=\"crs_soc.htm#SOC383H1\">SOC383H1</a> Distribution Requirement Status:  This is a Social Science courseBreadth Requirement:  Society and its Institutions (3)\r\n", "LEC": 24, "course_name": "Social Context of Public Policy ", "name": "Soc Context Public Policy", "TUT": 0, "PRA": 0, "wintersections": {"L0101": ["Y", "R", "I.

Learning frameworks and personal working styles inventories provide practical tools to assist the student to understand human nature and the logic of learning to become a competent leader of self, teams and organizations. The student prepares to become a competent leader by undertaking to learn (understand and integrate) key skills, character attributes and purposeful behaviours. The course presents strategies for development of high performance teams. Special attention is given to a number of subjects: transformational change, organizational culture, high performance work systems, and self-leadership. The course material is delivered through lectures, readings, in-class discussion and a team project.
