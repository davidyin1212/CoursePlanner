Top level dict:
	-key = course code (e.g. AST221H1)
	-value = second level dict

NOTE: field_size.json has a list of maximum number of characters used by each field in the second level dict
Second level dict:
	-key/values pairs:
		- 'LEC' : number of lecture hours
		- 'PRA' : number of practical hours
		- 'TUT' : number of tutorial hours
		- 'SEM' : number of seminar hours
		- 'CR' : number of credits
		- 'name' : course name
		- 'code' : course code
		- 'SC' : whether it is a fall course ('F'), a winter course ('S'), or a full-year course ('Y')
		- 'description' : course description
		- 'fallsections' : third level dict with lecture/tutorial/practical section info for fall
		- 'wintersections' :  third level dict with lecture/tutorial/practical section info for winter

Third level dict:
	-key = section code (e.g. L0101)
	-value = first level list
	
First level list:
	- values in order:
		- waitlist (Y/N)
		- Ind (still not sure what this is supposed to do but it's in the timetable)
		- Professor
		- second level list of time slots

Second level list:
	- list of third level lists (third level list contains time/location info)

Third level list:
	- values in order
		- location (e.e. GB404)
		- list of times

List of times:
	- each element is a list of the form [day,start time, end time] (e.g. ['M',12,14.5] is Monday from 12 to 2:30) times are in 24 hr format
